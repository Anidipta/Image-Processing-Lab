# Image-Processing-Lab

**ðŸ“… Day 1:** Performed RGB channel visualization, added salt & pepper noise, applied median filtering, converted to grayscale, analyzed histogram stats, and detected edges using Sobel operator.

**ðŸ“… Day 2:** Executed grayscale conversion, canny edge detection, rotation, cropping, pixel extraction, resizing, arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), translation, histogram analysis, and HDR tonemapping.

**ðŸ“… Day 3:** Performed brightness adjustment, grayscale and color image segmentation, color channel detection (R, G, B), image resizing and cropping, edge detection using Sobel and Canny, pixel-wise thresholding, grayscale conversion, image differencing, and visual comparisons using montage displays.
